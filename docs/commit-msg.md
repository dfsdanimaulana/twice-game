## Commit Message Guidelines

This project follows the conventional commit message format to maintain a clear and structured commit history. Please follow these guidelines when writing commit messages:

-   Use the following commit types:

    -   `feat`: A new feature or enhancement.
    -   `fix`: A bug fix.
    -   `chore`: Routine tasks, maintenance.
    -   `refactor`: refactoring.
    -   `docs`: Documentation changes.
    -   `style`: Code style changes (formatting, indentation).
    -   `test`: Adding or modifying tests.
    -   `perf`: Performance improvements.
    -   `ci`: CI/CD configuration changes.
    -   `build`: Build system or package manager changes.
    -   `revert`: Reverting a previous commit.

-   Optionally, you can include a "scope" after the commit type and a colon, followed by a space (e.g., "feat(auth): implement user authentication").
-   Start your commit message with the commit type (and optional scope) followed by a colon and a space (e.g., "feat: add new feature").
-   Keep the commit message concise and descriptive.
-   Use the imperative mood (e.g., "add" instead of "added" or "adding").
-   Provide additional details in the commit body if necessary.

Example commit messages:

-   `feat(auth): implement user authentication`
-   `fix(validation): resolve issue with login form validation`
-   `docs(readme): update README with usage instructions`

Following these guidelines helps us maintain a clear and organized commit history. Thank you for your contributions!
